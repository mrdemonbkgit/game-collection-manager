## Feature Ideas

### Energy-Based Game Randomizer

A smart recommendation feature that suggests games based on the user's current energy level and mood.

**How it works:**
- User inputs their current state, e.g., "I'm at 30% energy right now"
- App suggests a chill, low-effort game like **Dorfromantik**

- User inputs "100% energy, feeling like some action"
- App suggests something intense like **God of War** or **Monster Hunter**

**Implementation thoughts:**
- Could tie into the AI curation system (Gemini)
- Games would need energy/intensity tags or ratings
- Natural language input for describing mood
- Could also factor in: available time, last played genres, etc.

### Bio-Hacking Filter

A filter system based on cognitive/energy requirements for games.

**Filter by Energy Level:**
- **High Focus** - Games requiring intense concentration and quick reflexes (Sekiro, Returnal)
- **Low Energy** - Relaxing, low-stress games perfect for winding down (Dave the Diver, Dorfromantik)

**Could expand to:**
- Medium Focus (strategy games, RPGs)
- Background/Podcast games (grindy or repetitive gameplay)
- Short session vs Long session games
